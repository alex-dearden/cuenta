# About this code
* This code was never meant to be public or shown as sample of my work
* It was written to play around with new Swift features like `async await`, etc
* I was also playing around with a new git replacement called [jujutsu](https://github.com/martinvonz/jj)
* Because of this you might find strange commit messages and branch creation :)

# Why am I showing it
I am showing it as a sample of my work because it gives a good idea of what my process is and some of the code is actually quite good ;)

I think showing something like this is a lot more valuable than doing yet another test for yet another interview.
